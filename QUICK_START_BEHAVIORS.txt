  QUICK START: Enhanced Villager Behaviors
================================================================================

WHAT'S NEW:
-----------
✓ Villagers sleep at night and return to their houses
✓ Villagers automatically open and close doors
✓ Villagers socialize with each other (particles + mood boost)
✓ Villagers share food with hungry friends
✓ Villagers greet players with colored particles
✓ Daily routine: different behaviors at different times of day
✓ Smart pathfinding: flee home when hurt, recover when stuck


INSTALLATION:
-------------
1. This mod is already installed in your mods folder
2. Restart your Minetest/Luanti server or single-player world
3. New villagers will automatically get the enhanced behaviors
4. Existing villagers will upgrade on next server restart


SEEING IT IN ACTION:
--------------------
1. Find or build a village (houses with marker blocks like barrels/shrines)
2. Spawn villagers using eggs or wait for natural spawning
3. Fast-forward to night: /time 0
4. Watch villagers walk home and sleep (lay down animation)
5. Fast-forward to day: /time 6000
6. Watch villagers wake up and wander around
7. Spawn multiple villagers near each other - they'll socialize (particles!)
8. Feed one villager with bread, then watch them share food later


TIME OF DAY GUIDE:
------------------
/time 0      = Midnight (villagers sleeping)
/time 6000   = Dawn (villagers wake up)
/time 12000  = Noon (peak activity time)
/time 18000  = Dusk (villagers heading home)
/time 23900  = Almost midnight (villagers should be asleep)


WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
-----------------
🏠 SLEEP BEHAVIOR:
   - Villagers pathfind to their house at night
   - They lay down when they reach their house
   - They wake up automatically at dawn

🚪 DOOR USAGE:
   - Place wooden doors in houses
   - Watch villagers open them automatically
   - Doors close after 3 seconds

💬 SOCIAL INTERACTIONS:
   - Happy face particles appear between villagers
   - Happens every 30-60 seconds when near each other
   - Happy villagers improve sad villager moods

🍞 FOOD SHARING:
   - Blue particles indicate food sharing
   - Well-fed villagers help hungry ones
   - No sound plays (only visual feedback)

👋 PLAYER GREETINGS:
   - Green particles = friendly villager greeting
   - Red particles = hostile villager warning
   - Happens when you get within 1-3 blocks


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Q: Villagers aren't sleeping
A: Make sure it's actually night time (/time 0). Check if villagers have
   a house assigned - newly spawned ones should automatically link to
   nearby houses.

Q: Doors aren't opening
A: Ensure you're using standard doors with group:door. Custom door mods
   might need to be registered properly.

Q: No social interactions
A: Make sure you have 2+ villagers within 5 blocks of each other. Social
   interactions are random (5% chance per second), so be patient!

Q: Villager stuck far from home
A: They'll auto-teleport back after 5 minutes. You can speed this up by
   changing stuck_teleport_threshold in villager_behaviors.lua.


CONFIGURATION:
--------------
Edit: villager_behaviors.lua (lines 10-22)

Key settings:
- home_radius = 20              (how far villagers wander)
- sleep_radius = 3              (distance to trigger sleep)
- social_interaction_cooldown = 45   (seconds between socials)
- food_share_cooldown = 60      (seconds between food shares)


PERFORMANCE:
------------
✓ Optimized for 100+ villagers
✓ Random chance gates prevent lag spikes
✓ Minimal memory footprint per villager
✓ Compatible with existing mods


MORE INFO:
----------
See these files for detailed documentation:
- VILLAGER_BEHAVIORS.md      (complete feature documentation)
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md  (technical details and testing guide)


SUPPORT:
--------
If you encounter issues:
1. Check debug.txt for error messages
2. Use /lua commands to inspect villager data
3. Review VILLAGER_BEHAVIORS.md troubleshooting section
4. Report issues with full debug log and reproduction steps


ENJOY!
------
Watch your villages come alive with sleeping villagers, social interactions,
and dynamic daily routines. Villagers now feel like real inhabitants rather
than static NPCs!
