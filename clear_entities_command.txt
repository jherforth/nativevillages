# Manual Methods to Clear Entities in Minetest:

## Method 1: Using /clearobjects command (RECOMMENDED)
This is a built-in Minetest command that removes all entities and objects:

1. Start the server
2. Join as admin/server owner
3. Run in chat:
   /clearobjects full

This will remove ALL entities from the world (including dropped items, mobs, etc.)
The "full" option scans all mapblocks, not just loaded ones.

## Method 2: Using /deleteblocks (DESTRUCTIVE - NOT RECOMMENDED)
This removes entire map chunks - USE WITH CAUTION:
   /deleteblocks <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2>

## Method 3: Delete entity database files manually (Server must be STOPPED)
Navigate to your world folder and delete:
   - map.sqlite (or map_meta.txt if using that format)
   - players/ folder contents (if you want to reset player data too)

## Method 4: Use WorldEdit mod to clear entities in a region
If WorldEdit is installed:
   //clearobjects
