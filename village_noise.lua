VILLAGE SIZE CONFIGURATION:
- Spread parameter controls village compactness
- Current spread (100, 100, 100) creates villages ~100-160 nodes across
- This fits in 1-2 mapchunks (80x80x80 nodes each)
- Reduce spread further (e.g., 80, 80, 80) for single mapchunk villages
- Increase spread (e.g., 150, 150, 150) for larger villages

BUILDING DENSITY:
- Scale parameter (0.001) controls spawn rate
- Lower scale = fewer buildings, more rare villages
- Higher scale = more buildings, denser villages
