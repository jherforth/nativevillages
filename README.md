# Luanti Villagers

A comprehensive villager and village mod for Luanti (formerly Minetest) that adds living, breathing villages across multiple biomes with an advanced NPC mood and interaction system.

## Features

### 🏘️ Multiple Biome Villages

The mod generates villages in six distinct biomes, each with unique architecture and culture:

- **Grassland Villages** - Traditional settlements with farming communities
- **Desert Villages** - Sandy oasis towns with exotic markets
- **Savanna Villages** - Tribal communities with ceremonial shrines
- **Lake Villages** - Fishing communities built near water
- **Ice Villages** - Hardy settlements in frozen tundra
- **Cannibal Villages** - Dangerous jungle tribes with unique customs

### 👥 Diverse Villager Classes

Each village is populated with various NPC types, each with unique behaviors, trades, and roles:

- **Hostile** - Aggressive NPCs that attack on sight
- **Raider** - Combat-focused NPCs that attack players and other NPCs
- **Ranger** - Defensive NPCs that protect villages from monsters
- **Jeweler** - Traders specializing in precious gems and metals
- **Farmer** - Agricultural workers who trade crops and food
- **Blacksmith** - Craftsmen trading tools, weapons, and materials
- **Fisherman** - Aquatic specialists trading fish and fishing supplies
- **Cleric** - Mystical NPCs with magical items
- **Bum** - Humble NPCs with modest trades
- **Entertainer** - Social NPCs that enhance village atmosphere
- **Witch** - Hostile magic users that attack with teleportation spells

### 🎭 Advanced Mood System

NPCs feature a sophisticated emotional system with visual and audio feedback:

#### Moods
- **😊 Happy** - High mood value (80+)
- **🙂 Content** - Good mood (60-79)
- **😐 Neutral** - Average mood (40-59)
- **😢 Sad** - Low mood (20-39)
- **😠 Angry** - Very low mood (0-19)
- **🍖 Hungry** - When hunger exceeds 80
- **💔 Lonely** - When loneliness exceeds 80
- **😨 Scared** - When fear exceeds 70

#### Desires
NPCs display their needs through visual indicators:
- **🍞 Food** - When hungry (hunger > 70)
- **💰 Trade** - When they want to trade
- **👥 Companionship** - When lonely (loneliness > 60)
- **🛡️ Safety** - When scared (fear > 50)
- **💤 Rest** - When health is low (< 15)

#### Mood Factors
NPC mood is calculated based on:
- **Hunger** - Increases over time, decreases when fed
- **Loneliness** - Increases without interaction, decreases with player contact
- **Fear** - Increases during combat, decreases when safe
- **Health** - Lower health negatively affects mood
- **Ownership** - Tamed NPCs receive a mood bonus

### 🔊 Dynamic Sound System

NPCs emit sounds based on their emotional state:

- **Mood Sounds** - angry, content, happy, hungry, lonely, neutral, sad, scared
- **Action Sounds** - trade (when trading), villager_fed (when fed), rest (when needing rest)
- **Conditions**:
  - Plays when player is within 3 nodes of NPC
  - Configurable repeat delay (default: 10 seconds)
  - Trade and feed sounds override mood sounds
  - Rest desire rotates with mood sounds

**Configuration**: Edit `nativevillages.mood.sound_repeat_delay` in `npcmood.lua` to adjust sound frequency.

### 💱 Trading System

Interact with villagers to trade items:

1. **Initiate Trade** - Hold a desired trade item and approach the NPC
2. **Trade Indicator** - NPCs show a trade desire icon when interested
3. **Execute Trade** - Right-click while sneaking OR punch with the trade item
4. **Receive Items** - NPCs drop items from their loot table

**Trade Benefits**:
- Reduces loneliness (-25)
- Reduces hunger (-15)
- Improves overall mood
- Resets interaction timer

### 🍞 Feeding System

Keep villagers happy by feeding them:

- **Bread** - Reduces hunger significantly, heals +5 HP
- **Apple** - Reduces hunger moderately, heals +5 HP
- Plays special "villager_fed" sound
- Resets hunger to 1
- Resets interaction timer

### 🚪 Smart Doors System

Doors in villages automatically detect and respond to nearby NPCs:

- **Automatic Opening** - Doors open when NPCs approach within 2.5 blocks
- **Automatic Closing** - Doors close 3 seconds after all NPCs leave
- **Multi-NPC Support** - Multiple NPCs can use the same door without conflicts
- **Selective Opening** - Only opens for friendly NPCs, not hostile mobs
- **Quiet Operation** - Door sounds play at 30% volume to reduce noise

**Configuration**: Edit `smart_doors.lua` to adjust detection radius and timing.

### 🏗️ Village Buildings

Each biome features unique structures:

- **Grassland**: Houses, stables, ponds, ceremonial blots, altars
- **Desert**: Adobe houses, markets, wells, stables, cages
- **Savanna**: Thatched huts, shrines, thrones, wells, witch houses
- **Lake**: Waterfront houses, harbours, fish traps
