====================================================================
QUICK START - UPDATED VILLAGE SYSTEM
====================================================================

WHAT'S FIXED
============
✓ Buildings now spawn completely (no missing nodes)
✓ Villages are compact and cohesive
✓ Dense road networks with variety (straights, turns, junctions)
✓ 5 path types per biome instead of 1

HOW TO SEE THE IMPROVEMENTS
============================

1. START A NEW WORLD
   - Old chunks won't have the improvements
   - Generate fresh terrain to see the full system

2. FIND A VILLAGE
   - Villages are rare but cohesive
   - Look in: grassland, desert, ice, savanna, jungle, lake biomes
   - Use teleport commands if needed (depends on your game)

3. WHAT TO EXPECT
   - 5-8 houses clustered together
   - 15-20 path segments connecting them
   - Mix of straight roads, turns, and intersections
   - All buildings complete with no missing blocks

CONFIGURATION (if needed)
=========================

Make paths MORE dense:
  Edit paths.lua, line ~58:
    fill_ratio = 0.003  (was 0.002)

Make paths LESS dense:
  Edit paths.lua, line ~58:
    fill_ratio = 0.001  (was 0.002)

Make villages MORE common:
  Edit village_noise.lua, line 10:
    scale = 0.002  (was 0.001)

Make villages MORE compact:
  Edit village_noise.lua, line 11:
    spread = {x=250, y=250, z=250}  (was 300)

VERIFICATION
============

Check the game log (debug.txt) for:
  "[nativevillages] Path system loaded with X path decorations"

If you see this message, the system loaded correctly.

Expected decoration count:
  - 15 decorations (3 biomes × 5 path types)
  - Plus desert/jungle if schematics exist

AVAILABLE NOW
=============

Biomes with full path systems:
  ✓ Grassland (grass_dirt_*)
  ✓ Savanna (savanna_dirt_*)
  ✓ Ice/Snow (snow_dirt_*)

All biomes have force_placement on buildings:
  ✓ Grassland
  ✓ Desert
  ✓ Ice/Snow
  ✓ Savanna
  ✓ Jungle
  ✓ Lake

TO ADD DESERT/JUNGLE PATHS
==========================

Create these schematics following the naming pattern:
  desert_dirt_forward_straight_5x5.mts
  desert_dirt_sideways_straight_5x5.mts
  desert_dirt_left_5x5.mts
  desert_dirt_right_5x5.mts
  desert_dirt_junction_5x5.mts

And/or:
  jungle_dirt_forward_straight_5x5.mts
  jungle_dirt_sideways_straight_5x5.mts
  jungle_dirt_left_5x5.mts
  jungle_dirt_right_5x5.mts
  jungle_dirt_junction_5x5.mts

The system will auto-detect and register them!

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

No villages appearing:
  → They're rare by design
  → Try teleporting far from spawn
  → Or increase scale in village_noise.lua

Buildings incomplete:
  → Old chunks - generate new terrain
  → Or something prevented force_placement

Few paths:
  → Check you're in grass/savanna/ice biome
  → Desert/jungle need schematics first
  → Or increase fill_ratio in paths.lua

Too many paths:
  → Decrease fill_ratio in paths.lua
  → Or decrease scale in dense_path_noise
