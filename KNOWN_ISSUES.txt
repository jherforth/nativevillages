KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS
====================================================================

ISSUE: Floating Dirt/Stone Artifacts
-------------------------------------
SYMPTOM: Random dirt or stone blocks floating in the air above villages

CAUSE: Foundation filling system had bugs that caused it to place
       blocks in mid-air instead of only under buildings

STATUS: ✅ FIXED - Foundation filling completely removed

SOLUTION: Buildings now use placement parameters only:
  - place_offset_y = 0 (ground level)
  - height_max = 1 (perfectly flat terrain only)
  - No automated filling
  - utils.lua completely removed

RESULT: Buildings spawn on flat ground with no gaps and no artifacts


ISSUE: Buildings Still Floating
--------------------------------
SYMPTOM: Buildings appear 1-3 nodes above ground

CAUSE: Old chunks generated with old parameters (place_offset_y = 1)

STATUS: Expected behavior in old chunks

SOLUTION: Generate new world or explore new chunks
          Old chunks cannot be retroactively fixed


ISSUE: No Path/Road System
---------------------------
SYMPTOM: Villages don't have connecting paths or roads

STATUS: Removed (paths spawned randomly, not with villages)

EXPLANATION: The path system was placing roads randomly throughout
             the world instead of clustering with village buildings.
             Removed until a proper village-aware system can be built.

FUTURE: May add back with proper village center detection


ISSUE: Buildings Missing Nodes
-------------------------------
SYMPTOM: Houses have holes or missing blocks

CAUSE: Terrain overriding schematic (old issue, should be fixed)

STATUS: ✅ FIXED with force_placement flag

SOLUTION: If still occurring, check:
  1. Is this an old chunk? (Generate new world)
  2. Is force_placement in flags? (Should be in all *buildings.lua)
  3. Check debug.log for errors


ISSUE: Villages Too Rare/Common
--------------------------------
SYMPTOM: Can't find villages OR villages everywhere

CAUSE: Noise scale determines spawn frequency

STATUS: Configurable

SOLUTION: Edit village_noise.lua, line 10:
  scale = 0.002  // More villages (from 0.001)
  scale = 0.0005 // Fewer villages (from 0.001)


ISSUE: Buildings Spawning on Hills (FIXED v2)
----------------------------------------------
SYMPTOM: Buildings appear on slopes with visible gaps underneath

CAUSE: height_max only checks single column, not entire footprint
       Missing all_floors flag meant only center was checked

STATUS: ✅ FIXED - Added all_floors flag + height_max = 0

SOLUTION: All *buildings.lua files now use:
          - all_floors flag (checks ENTIRE schematic footprint)
          - height = 0, height_max = 0 (zero variation = perfectly flat)

TRADE-OFF: Buildings are MUCH rarer (perfectly flat terrain required)
           But always perfectly grounded with zero gaps

ADJUSTMENT: If buildings too rare, increase height_max:
            height_max = 1 (slight gaps, more buildings)
            height_max = 2 (moderate gaps, many buildings)
            height_max = 3 (larger gaps, maximum buildings)


ISSUE: Chest Loot Issues (FIXED v2)
------------------------------------
SYMPTOM: Village chests show no items or glitched inventory
        Inventory unusable, items not accessible

CAUSE: register_on_placenode doesn't fire for schematic decorations
       Chests from schematics never triggered the filling callback

STATUS: ✅ FIXED - Now using LBM (Loading Block Modifier)

SOLUTION: loot.lua now uses minetest.register_lbm
          LBMs run when blocks load/generate (perfect for decorations)
          Tracks filled chests to avoid refilling
          run_at_every_load = false for one-time processing

RESULT: Village chests properly filled with biome-appropriate loot
        Chests fully usable, items visible and accessible


====================================================================
REPORTING NEW ISSUES
====================================================================

If you encounter new issues:

1. Check if it's in old chunks (generate new world to test)
2. Check debug.log for error messages
3. Verify file modifications are correct (grep for key values)
4. Note which biome the issue occurs in
5. Include screenshots if visual issue

Common false positives:
- Old chunks will have old behavior (not a bug)
- Missing path schematics means no paths (expected)
- Small gaps under buildings (acceptable trade-off)
